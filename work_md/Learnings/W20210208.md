- Learning
	- **Power Automate** - Scheduled occurrence flows needs to be mentioned time and date apart from start time. One can trigger flow from mobile but there are chances that parallel flows can run which can lead to duplication of data in Archive list. Do not let parallel flow run.
- Submitted 2020 Performance review with all the comments received from stakeholders.

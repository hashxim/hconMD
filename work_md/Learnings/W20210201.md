# Learning Target
Complete PowerApp Governance toolkit PDF by Microsoft

# Day Summary
## 20210201
- **PowerApp** - Beazley UW went live today. 
	- Technical Learning - Power BI was not able to fetch records if any list has 0 records. I am not sure if this is PBI issue or report design issue.
- **Operational Learning** - For monthly update, Louis document was good. All items needs to be  in separate row and how to track it fully.

## 20210202
- **PowerApp**:
	- Changes implemented - Conditional view of count and Filter on Status in Tasks Page
	- There needs to be a way to capture what intangible benefits ProReport brings to the org
- **Strategic Learning**:
	- ProReport - ProReport is also an attempt to also change the behaviour of team members where they no more have total control on data they report. Through log sheets, even if someone took 10 mins to process, he/she was free to update only 5 mins in the log sheet. ProReport addresses that issue by pushing the users to update the submission in a timely fashion.

# Introduction
Key Learning 
- Investing is psychology, history, sociology, politics and science (reading financials)
- Know yourself first - Knowing your temperament and mental fortitude
# Cyclical Industries
Markets are more cyclical than we think. Cars, financial services are examples. 

## Types of Cyclicality
- Deep cyclicality (Commodities)
- Moderate Cyclicality (Cars, Financial services)
- Low cyclicality (FMCG)

Even economy is cyclical. One cannot run away from cyclicals. Almost everything is cyclical, degree may vary. Understanding cycles can help, even if one doesn't want to delve in deep cyclicals.

## Timing
There is a timing element in cyclicals. 
- We don't have to be "exactly right". We are good even if we are "approximately right"
- Don't have to get in at "bottom", not get out at the "top"
- You just have to get the general direction right
- Don't mind leaving something on the table, during exits

## What to comprehend?
- One has to comprehend "business cycle" as well as "market cycle". They might not coincide. "Best price" may come before "best results" and "worst price" may come before "worst results".
- Excel investing rarely works in cyclicals, especially deep cyclicals.

##  Commodity Price Cycle
![Commodity Cycle](https://github.com/hashxim/hconMD/blob/master/work_md/Obsidian/Resources/Commodity%20Cycle.JPG?raw=true)

Basic thing to look at in cyclicals is Demand and Supply. 

Stages of the cycle:
- Demand push happens, price accelerates
- A lot of CAPEX comes in when prices and demand is good which lead to demand destruction
- Market comes in balance and CAPEX is peaking means no more announcement of new CAPEX
- There is oversupply
- High inventories built and strong supply reaction (some companies goes bust and supply goes out of the system) and there is severe price correction
-   And then slowly it starts going up again

One of the factors to look at which you exit is when lot of CAPEX coming in which means there will be lot of supply in future (or atleast be alert if you do not exit at that point in time). 

# Contrarian Approach 
- Buy when ratios are bad - EBITDA margins, ROE are down. Company might be in loss
- Sell when companies show sharp uptick and company becomes highly profitable
- Buy when PE is 60 (or -ve) and sell when is at 6
- Buy when sector is neglected and sell when it is hot
- Buy when no one is covering the stock and sell when many buy reports come
- The bet is on "reversal to mean"

# Evaluation
- Triggers shows up. Identify the sector/commodity behind the trigger
- Study the past cycle
- Study production data, supply/demand. 
- Check for capacity utilization. When trigger happens, one will observe that capacity utilization is very low.
- Check for CAPEX 
- Check for margins. At entry, the margins would be at the lowest
- Check price to book (Current, historical during upcycle and downcycles). PE is not the better criteria, P/B is better criteria
- Check replacement cost 

# Investment Process
- Prepare list of stocks with theme. (Have seen that the best company gives the least returns) You  need to have mix of companies so follow basket approach.
- Shortlist 4/5 plays. User basket approach in investing
- Stress test - Can the company survive a	nother couple of years of downturn?
- Wait for some companies to go bust or close down some plants. Enter with a small position and wait for things to turn and then get in. 
- Check insider buying/selling. This sometimes will turn out to be positive and sometimes bad (Promoters might not know what is happening) 
- Start buying at highest pessimism levels
- As cycle turns, add

# Examples of Triggers
- Sugar - 2 years of monsoon failure in India and failed Brazil crop in 2015
- Paper - Largest producer BILT plants closing down (4/5 plants closed due to debt)
- Fertilizers - A good monsoon after 2 failed years
- Polyfilms - Increasing delta between RM and finished product
- Chemicals - China measures for pollution control and closing of many units , ADD. You see ADD is increasing
- Metals / Mining - Chinese plants started closo

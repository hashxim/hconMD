# Introduction
Key Learning 
- Investing is psychology, history, sociology, politics and science (reading financials)
- Know yourself first - Knowing your temperament and mental fortitude
# Cyclical Industries
Markets are more cyclical than we think. Cars, financial services are examples. 

## Types of Cyclicality
- Deep cyclicality (Commodities)
- Moderate Cyclicality (Cars, Financial services)
- Low cyclicality (FMCG)

Even economy is cyclical. One cannot run away from cyclicals. Almost everything is cyclical, degree may vary. Understanding cycles can help, even if one doesn't want to delve in deep cyclicals.

## Timing
There is a timing element in cyclicals. 
- We don't have to be "exactly right". We are good even if we are "approximately right"
- Don't have to get in at "bottom", not get out at the "top"
- You just have to get the general direction right
- Don't mind leaving something on the table, during exits

## What to comprehend?
- One has to comprehend "business cycle" as well as "market cycle". They might not coincide. "Best price" may come before "best results" and "worst price" may come before "worst results".
- Excel investing rarely works in cyclicals, especially deep cyclicals.

##  Commodity Price Cycle

Basic thing to look at in cyclicals is Demand and Supply. 

Stages of the cycle:
- Demand push happens, price accelerates
- A lot of CAPEX comes in when prices and demand is good which lead to demand destruction

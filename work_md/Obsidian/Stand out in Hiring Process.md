`Summary`

# Introduction
Hiring Process is Ultra-competitive.  Fancy degree and credentials are not the only things which stand out

# How to stand out
## Do your research
- Spend few hours researching the company and role
- Learn company mission
- Read up on recent news / its market
- Background key leaders

## Embrace "I don't know"
- You cannot know everything
- Don't be afraid to say "I don't know" but then follow up
	- “I don’t know, but I’ll dig in and follow up with an email.”

## Stop fearing Rejection
- Don't be embarrassed to admit that you've been rejected

## Prepare "Why Us"?
- What attracted you to this company, The more specific, more better
- Generic answers (I love investing) gets minus marks. Specific answers win

## Stalk (Non-creepily)
- If you know who would be interviewing you, spend time learning about their background and experience
- Identify potential bonding areas (same alma mater, similar interests, hobbies etc)

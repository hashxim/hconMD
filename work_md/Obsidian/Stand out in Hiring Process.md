`Summary`

# Introduction
Hiring Process is Ultra-competitive.  Fancy degree and credentials are not the only things which stand out

# How to stand out
## Do your research
- Spend few hours researching the company and role
- Learn company mission
- Read up on recent news / its market
- Background key leaders

## Embrace "I don't know"
- You cannot know everything
- Don't be afraid to say "I don't know" but then follow up
	- “I don’t know, but I’ll dig in and follow up with an email.”

## Stop fearing

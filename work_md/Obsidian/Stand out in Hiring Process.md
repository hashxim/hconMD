	- “I don’t know, but I’ll dig in and follow up with an email.”

## Stop fearing Rejection
- Don't be embarrassed to admit that you've been rejected

## Prepare "Why Us"?
- What attracted you to this company, The more specific, more better
- Generic answers (I love investing) gets minus marks. Specific answers win

## Stalk (Non-creepily)
- If you know who would be interviewing you, spend time learning about their background and experience
- Identify potential bonding areas (same alma mater, similar interests, hobbies etc)

## Seek Warm Intros
- Warm intros and references are holy grail of competitive hiring
- Check on LinkedIn if there are any close connections and use them

- Include a specific detail (from your note book) so it doesn't appear generic

## Ask Unique Questions
- "Do you have any questions for me" - Its an opportunity to show off your differentiated initiative and hustle

## Real Weaknesses
- We tend to give weaknesses that are actually Strength (I am too Detail oriented)
- Tell real weakness but also back it up with plan on how to overcome it

## Focus on Long Term

## Nail the Cover Letter

- Be yourself, but be sure to get across

`Summary`

# Introduction
> Some things scale well. Double their size and you get double the output (or more). Other things donâ€™t, and my God is it important to know which is which.

Robert Wadlow was the largest human ever known. [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Wadlow). Abnormality in pituitary gland bombarded growth hormone leading to his size. At the time of death, he was 8' 11'' tall. He might sound like a superhuman but his life was not. He required steel legs braces and limped, would require leaning on wall. So much pressure was put on his legs that he had little feeling below his knees.

# Definition
> Strategy is the pattern of decisions in a company that determines and reveals its ==objectives, purposes, or goals==, produces the principal ==policies and plans for achieving those goals==, and defines ==the range of business the company is to pursue==, the kind of economic and human organization it intends to be, and the nature of the economic and noneconomic ==contribution it intends to make== to its shareholders, employees, customers, and communities. - Kenneth Andrews, The Concepts of Corporate Strategy, 1971

Highlights:
- **Objectives, Purposes or goals** - Defines the mission of the organization. Part of the strategy is to understand the objective of the organization.
- **Policies and plans for achieving those goals** - What is the way in which they are going to deliver these on this mission
- **The range of business the company is to pursue** - How do we define the scope of the business, what are the businesses and markets it decides to plan? Is it a global company or a local company? 
- **Contribution it intends to make** - both economic and non-economic. How does it create value and for whom it create value for?

## A simple Strategy Schema
Start with
- **Strategic Mission** - A firm's values and purpose and the scope of its operations in product and market terms. How do we define business and do we express its aspirations?
- **Strategic Plan** - It is the way in which you achieve your strategic mission - How does a firm positions itself in the market and develops and leverages internal resources and capabilities to accomplish its strategic mission
- **Strategic Actions** - Individual actions taken to execute the strategic plan in pursuit of the strategic mission. This could include like M&A, innovating a new product line or developing robust supply chain. Together these actions define what is the strategy of the organization. 


# Strategic Analysis
**Definition:** The assessment of an organization's current competitive position and the identification of valuable competitive positions in the future and how to achieve them.

Strategic analysis is done
- From a generalist's perspective (integrative, foundational) - we cross the functional boundaries of the business. We bring marketing and Finance together and try to understand in an integrative matter. Also strategy analysis is foundational which means strategy serves as base by which other activities the organization flow out of. 
- Using Strategic reasoning (rivalry, dynamics, complexity) - We need to think strategy in terms of larger competitive market in which we operate. 
- Grounded in analytics and data - use it to go further in strategic analysis.
- Applying appropriate tools and frameworks

## Who does Strategic Analysis?

# The Strategist's Challenge
When one doing Strategic analysis, one need to ask 3 fundamental questions:

- Value - What are the values of the organization? Values, mission, scope of the organization? How do they define themselves?
	- Mission Statements - One way to analyse is to look at mission statement. We can learn firm's values and what motivates and inspires the company from its mission statement, which is key to understanding what it is trying to accomplish and why.
- Opportunities - The external environment in which you operate. What is the market demand and others providing value in similar ways?

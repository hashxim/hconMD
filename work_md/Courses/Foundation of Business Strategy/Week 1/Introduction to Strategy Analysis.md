# Definition
> Strategy is the pattern of decisions in a company that determines and reveals its ==objectives, purposes, or goals==, produces the principal ==policies and plans for achieving those goals==, and defines ==the range of business the company is to pursue==, the kind of economic and human organization it intends to be, and the nature of the economic and noneconomic ==contribution it intends to make== to its shareholders, employees, customers, and communities. - Kenneth Andrews, The Concepts of Corporate Strategy, 1971

Highlights:
- **Objectives, Purposes or goals** - Defines the mission of the organization. Part of the strategy is to understand the objective of the organization.
- **Policies and plans for achieving those goals** - What is the way in which they are going to deliver these on this mission
- **The range of business the company is to pursue** - How do we define the scope of the business, what are the businesses and markets it decides to plan? Is it a global company or a local company? 
- **Contribution it intends to make** - both economic and non-economic. How does it create value and for whom it create value for?

## A simple Strategy Schema
Start with
- **Strategic Mission** - A firm's values and purpose and the scope of its operations in product and market terms. How do we define business and do we express its aspirations?
- **Strategic Plan** - It is the way in which you achieve your strategic mission - How does a firm positions itself in the market and develops and leverages internal resources and capabilities to accomplish its strategic mission
- **Strategic Actions** - Individual actions taken to execute the strategic plan in pursuit of the strategic mission. This could include like M&A, innovating a new product line or developing robust supply chain. Together these actions define what is the strategy of the organization. 


# Strategic Analysis
**Definition:** The assessment of an organization's current competitive position and the identification of valuable competitive positions in the future and how to achieve them.

Strategic analysis is done
- From a generalist's perspective (integrative, foundational) - we cross the functional boundaries of the business. We bring marketing and Finance together and try to understand in an integrative matter. Also strategy analysis is foundational which means strategy serves as base by which other activities the organization flow out of. 
- Using Strategic reasoning (rivalry, dynamics, complexity) - We need to think strategy in terms of larger competitive market in which we operate. 
- Grounded in analytics and data - use it to go further in strategic analysis.
- Applying appropriate tools and frameworks

## Who does Strategic Analysis?
- Someone who formulates and implements strategy
	- CEO or President
	- Entrepreneur / Owner
	- VP Strategic Planning / Chief Strategy Officer
	- General Manager of a Business Unit
- Someone who evaluates strategy
	- Investors
	- Financial Analysts
- Someone who recommends future strategic actions
	- Consultants
	- Secondary Stakeholders

# The Strategist's Challenge
When one doing Strategic analysis, one need to ask 3 fundamental questions:

- **Value** - What are the values of the organization? Values, mission, scope of the organization? How do they define themselves?
	- Mission Statements - One way to analyse is to look at mission statement. We can learn firm's values and what motivates and inspires the company from its mission statement, which is key to understanding what it is trying to accomplish and why.
- **Opportunities** - The external environment in which you operate. What is the market demand and others providing value in similar ways?
- **Capabilities** - This is more internally focused. What are the assets they can leverage to meet market opportunities? Think about competitive advantage. 
	- Competitive Advantage is always relative to your competition. Its not sufficient to be good at something if everyone else is good as well. We are interested to understand those distinctive things that differentiate it from its peers

The intersection of above three questions reveal "Valuable competitive position". Those positions within a market that an organization can take that will allow them to survive and thrive and create the most value for its stakeholders.

# Fundamental principle of Business Strategy
Presenter takes example of Pets.com example which flourished during late 1990s but failed as a business due to immense competition. This highlights an important thing:
> "If everyone can do it, it's difficult to create and capture value from it"

Alternatively
> "In a perfectly competitive market, no firm realizes economic profits (rents)"

## Economic Profits (or Rents)
**Definition:** Economic profits are returns in excess of what an investor expects to earn from investments of similar risk (i.e. in excess of the opportunity cost of capital)

![Economic Profit can be very different from Accounting Profit](https://github.com/hashxim/hconMD/blob/master/work_md/Courses/Foundation%20of%20Business%20Strategy/Resources/Economic%20vs%20Accounting%20Profit.JPG?raw=true)

Here in above example, compared to Microsoft and IBM, General Motors has generated negative $5B in Economic profit due to the fact that the money invested to create such accounting profit is disproportionately greater than what is required to generate profit for Microsoft and IBM.

### Measuring E conomic Profit
**Tobin's Q**
 - Ratio of a firm's market value to its asset replacement value
 - Directly measures "rents" above those to physical inputs
 - Difficult to calculate because it requires knowledge of assets' replacement value
Alternative is DCF

**Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)**
- Measures value of firm going forward (Rev - Cost - Other investment)
- Discount rate reflects return to equity (i.e. opportunity cost). Opportunity cost represents inflation and over and above inflation that we expect to make in similar investments of similar risks
- Positive NPV indicates rents over and above returns to all inputs 

# Competitive Markets
Fundamental Principle :
> "In a perfectly competitive market, no firm realizes economic profits (rents)"

This suggest some type of market inefficiency needs to be there for economic profits.

## Demand-Supply Curve
On Y axis we have price and on X axis we have quantity.
Demand curve is downward sloping because as we lower prices, the more people will demand for it. Supply curve is upward sloping because as prices increases there is more supply that you're willing to provide. 
Now fundamental law says that pri

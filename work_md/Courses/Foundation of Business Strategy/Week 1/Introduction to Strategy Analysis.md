# Definition
> Strategy is the pattern of decisions in a company that determines and reveals its ==objectives, purposes, or goals==, produces the principal ==policies and plans for achieving those goals==, and defines ==the range of business the company is to pursue==, the kind of economic and human organization it intends to be, and the nature of the economic and noneconomic ==contribution it intends to make== to its shareholders, employees, customers, and communities. - Kenneth Andrews, The Concepts of Corporate Strategy, 1971

Highlights:
- **Objectives, Purposes or goals** - Defines the mission of the organization. Part of the strategy is to understand the objective of the organization.
- **Policies and plans for achieving those goals** - What is the way in which they are going to deliver these on this mission
- **The range of business the company is to pursue** - How do we define the scope of the business, what are the businesses and markets it decides to plan? Is it a global company or a local company? 
- **Contribution it intends to make** - both economic and non-economic. How does it create value and for whom it create value for?

## A simple Strategy Schema
Start with
- **Strategic Mission** - A firm's values and purpose and the scope of its operations in product and market terms. How do we define business and do we express its aspirations?
- **Strategic Plan** - It is the way in which you achieve your strategic mission - How does a firm positions itself in the market and develops and leverages internal resources and capabilities to accomplish its strategic mission
- **Strategic Actions** - Individual actions taken to execute the strategic plan in pursuit of the strategic mission.

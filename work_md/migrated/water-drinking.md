# Water Drinking

`Summary`

### Water in Humans

Depending on factors like location, fat index, age, and sex, the average human is between 55-60% water. **At birth:** 75% water \(similar to fish\). Water composition drops to 65% by their first birthday.

### Role of water in body

* Cushion and lubricate joints
* Regulate temperature
* Nourish the brain and spinal cord. 

Water isn't only in our blood. An adult's brain and heart are almost three quarters water \(amount of moisture in a banana\). That's roughly equivalent to the amount of moisture in a banana. Lungs are more similar to an apple at 83%. And even seemingly dry human bones are 31% water.

### Why do we need water?

If we are essentially made of water, why do we still need to drink so much?

We lose 2-3 Litres of water each day through:

* Sweat
* Urine
* Bowel movements
* Breathing

We need to compensate for the fluid loss. Maintaining a balanced water level is essential to **avoid dehydration or over-hydration, both of which can have devastating effects on overall health**.

### Dehydration

At first detection of low water levels, sensory receptors in the brain's hypothalamus signal the release of antidiuretic hormone. When it reached the kidneys, it creates aquaporins, special channels that enable blood to absorb and retain more water, leading to concentrated, dark urine.

Increased dehydration can cause notable drops in energy, mood, skin moisture, and blood pressure, as well as signs of cognitive impairment. A dehydrated brain works harder to accomplish the same amount as a normal brain, and it even temporarily shrinks because of its lack of water.

### Over-Hydration

Over-hydration, or hyponatremia, is usually caused by overconsumption of water in a short amount of time.

Athletes are often the victims of over-hydration because of complications in regulating water levels in extreme physical conditions.

Whereas the dehydrated brain amps up the production of antidiuretic hormone, the over-hydrated brain slows, or even stops, releasing it into the blood. Sodium electrolytes in the body become diluted, causing cells to swell. In severe cases, the kidneys can't keep up with the resulting volumes of dilute urine. Water intoxication then occurs, possibly causing headache, vomiting, and, in rare instances, seizures or death.

But that's a pretty extreme situation. On a normal, day-to-day basis, maintaining a well-hydrated system is easy to manage for those of us fortunate enough to have access to clean drinking water.

### How much water/day

For a long time, conventional wisdom said that we should drink eight glasses a day. That estimate has since been fine-tuned.

Now, the consensus is that the amount of water we need to imbibe depends largely on our weight and environment. **The recommended daily intake varies from between 2.5-3.7 liters of water for men, and about 2-2.7 liters for women, a range that is pushed up or down if we are healthy, active, old, or overheating**.

### Indirect Water Sources

While water is the healthiest hydrator, other beverages, even those with caffeine like coffee or tea, replenish fluids as well. And **water within food makes up about a fifth of our daily H20 intake**. Fruits and vegetables like strawberries, cucumbers, and even broccoli are over 90% water, and can supplement liquid intake while providing valuable nutrients and fiber.

### Long term benefits

Optimal hydration can **lower the chance of stroke, help manage diabetes, and potentially reduce the risk of certain types of cancer**. No matter what, getting the right amount of liquid makes a world of difference in how you'll feel, think, and function day to day.

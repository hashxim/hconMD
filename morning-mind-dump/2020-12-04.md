# Work
So finally today I am going to submit my project report. I had been working on it since past 5-6 months and I feel good about it and satisfied with my work.

# Transfer
I have to transfer some money to India since I can take advantage of high FX rate currently. I am bit in dilemma since we would require money if we decide to buy some property in coming few months. For that every penny we have would help towards deposit. I also wanted to keep balance between what is here and what I want to send India too. I need to decide soon how much I need to send which is not going to be enough.

I think I will go ahead with lower sum of money to ensure that I have enough in India and also take advantage of high FX rate. 

# Help
Harshit asked for 1L yesterday. He has helped me in past without asking for it back. I feel since he is in a situation where he needs help, so I feel that I should help him. This would be another reason to send money to India. 

# Home
I already made projections that we should be able to afford house up to 350 by March 2021 but I don't think it would be possible if I go ahead with my transfer and Rishika buys iPhone and recently she has also repaid her loan. So we are anyways short of deposit right now and the projections may not materialize in give time.

# Meditation
I started with few session but its not regular. I need to ensure that I am meditating regularly as I am really interested to see what benefits I get from meditation.

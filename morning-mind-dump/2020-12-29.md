# PBS Planning
Completed planning for most of the strategic priorities. Few things related to Personal is still pending since its very abstract and qualitative in nature which poses the problem of how to measure it. I would be thinking about it and divide the targets quarter wise. I think a broad target for year has to be set and then quarterly targets has to be set.

# Mood
Initially felt little worried since I was not able to work on PBS but in later part of the day, I was able to allot some time in which I reviewed some priorities and set associated task which will help in keeping those goals in check.

# Investing
Khanna wants me to sell most of the portfolio holding. I totally understand that he wants to minimize the loss which are already there from Junk stocks and being market at all time high, he wants to correct past mistakes and take action this time. I agree with him but partially. I think for all those stocks which have some new developments which can further go up should be held while other which are just rising due to market should be disposed off. 

I am thinking to prepare a sheet which will track all my portfolio action decision and track how it worked over the period of time.

# Idea
Investment Journal should have entry for all the watchlist stocks and a system which should be able to capture the these details.

# Tomorrow Planning
I would like to
- Start work out (Abs)
- Start Meditation

# Exercise
I need to start working out. I have much fat around my belly. Need to get into a habit every morning to start work out. I was asking for cap for my head to not feel cold when I go for running. 

I also need to think about clothes I am going to wear while running. 

# Meditation
I though to start meditate from yesterday but again I missed. I am planning to meditate when Rishika gets up since that is a trigger for me. Another time can be when I am wake up.

# Window sealant
Crack in the window frame is doing much damage. Bedroom is close to North pole. Silicon sealant has already arrived and I need to work that out today.

# Work
I was thinking to do some work for the project but I have other weekend commitments too. I am hoping if I am able to do some since it will make me comfortable and relaxed at mind level.

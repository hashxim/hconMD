#  Foreword
> The first notion is that high returns tend to attract capital, just as low returns repel it. The resulting ebb and flow of capital affects the competitive environment of industries in often predictable ways – what we like to call the capital  cycle.


> The second  guiding idea is that  management  skill in allocating capital is vital over the long-term. Picking managers who allocate capital  in  sensible  ways  is crucial to  successful stock selection. The best managers understand the capital  cycle as  it  operates  in  their industries  and don’t lose their heads in the good times

> We found that  the kind  of  opportunities created by  capital  cycle analysis often have long gestation periods, as the timing of the pay-off was highly uncertain. As  a result, we  discovered that  our approach has worked best when we  invested in  a relatively large number of  stocks, holding onto  them for long periods of  time


# Introduction 
> Typically, capital is attracted into high-return businesses and leaves when returns fall below the cost of  capital. This  process is  not static, but cyclical  – there is  constant flux. The inflow of capital leads to new investment, which over time increases capacity in the sector and eventually pushes down returns. Conversely, when returns are low,  capital  exits  and  capacity  is  reduced;  over  time,  then,  profitability  recovers. From  the perspective of  the wider economy,  this  cycle resembles Schumpeter’s process of  “creative destruction”  – as  the function  of  the bust, which follows the boom, is to clear away the misallocation of capital that has occurred during the upswing.

> capital  cycle analysis looks at  how the competitive position of  a company is affected by  changes in  the industry’s supply side.

> Capital cycle analysis is really about how competitive advantage changes over time, viewed from an investor’s perspective.

## A STYLIZED CAPITAL CYCLE
> The ups and downs of this fictional widget manufacturer describes a typical capital cycle. High current profitability often leads to overconfidence among managers, who confuse benign industry  conditions with  their own skill – a mistake encouraged by  the media,  which is constantly looking for corporate heroes and villains. Both investors and managers are engaged in making demand projections. Such forecasts have a wide margin of error and are prone to systematic biases. In good times, the demand forecasts tend to be too optimistic and in bad times overly pessimistic. 
> High profitability loosens capital  discipline  in  an  industry. When returns are high, companies are inclined to  boost capital  spending. Competitors are likely to follow – perhaps they are equally hubristic, or maybe they just don’t want  to  lose market share. Besides,  CEO pay is often set in  relation  to a company’s earnings or  market capitalization, thus  incentivizing managers to  grow  their firm’s  assets. When a company announces with  great fanfare a large increase in capacity, its share price often rises. Growth investors like growth! Momentum investors like momentum!


> The Macro example also shows the lag between a rise in  capital  spending and its impact on  supply, which is  characteristic of  the capital  cycle. The delay between investment and new production means that supply changes are lumpy (i.e.,  the supply curve is not smooth, as  portrayed in  the economics textbooks) and prone to overshooting. In fact, the market instability created by lags between changes in supply and production has long been recognized by  economists (it is known as  the “cobweb effect”). 
> The capital  cycle turns down  as  excess  capacity becomes apparent  and past demand forecasts are shown to have been overly optimistic. As profits collapse, management  teams are changed, capital  expenditure is slashed, and the industry  starts  to  consolidate. The reduction in  investment  and contraction in industry supply paves the way for a recovery of profits.

## THE CAPITAL CYCLE ANOMALY
> Firms with  the lowest asset growth have outperformed those with the highest asset growth, as the chart from  Société Générale  strategist Andrew Lapthorne  shows 

> Nobel laureate Eugene Fama and his colleague Ken French have suggested adding two more factors to their model: profits and investment.16  With  regards  to  the  capital  cycle,  Fama and French observe that  companies which have  invested  less  have  delivered higher returns. This finding has been termed the “asset-growth anomaly.” A paper in  the  Journal of  Finance  reports  that  corporate  events  associated  with asset expansion – such as  mergers & acquisitions,  equity  issuance and new loans – tend to be followed by low returns.17  Conversely, events associated with  asset contraction – including spin-offs,  share repurchases,  debt prepayments and dividend initiations – are followed by  positive excess  returns.  The negative impact on shareholder returns from expanding corporate assets was found to  persist for up  to  five  years.
> The  Journal of  Finance  authors  conclude  that  firm  asset  growth  is  a stronger  determinant of  returns than  traditional value (low  price-to-book), size (market capitalization), and momentum (both long and short horizon). Other finance economists have found that companies often accelerate investment after their stocks have done relatively well and that these same companies later underperform. This suggests  that  asset growth  may explain the phenomenon of momentum reversal.
> recent  research  is  edging  towards  the  conclusion  that  the excess  returns historically observed from  value stocks and the low returns from  growth  stocks are not independent of  asset growth. This leads to  a key insight of  the capital  cycle investment  approach:  when  analyzing the prospects of both value and growth stocks, it is necessary to take into account asset growth, at both the company and the sectoral level. 

> Companies which earn above their cost of capital tend to invest more, thereby driving down  their future  returns,  while companies which fail  to  earn  their cost of capital  behave  in  the  opposite  way.  This  point  is  recognized  by  Benjamin Graham  and David Dodd in  Security  Analysis  (1934), the bible of  value investing: 
> 
> *A business which sells at a premium does so because it earns a large return  upon  its capital; this large return  attracts  competition;  and generally speaking, it is not likely to continue indefinitely. Conversely in  the case of  a business  selling at  a large discount because of  abnormally low earnings. The absence of new competition, the withdrawal of  old competition from  the field,  and other natural economic forces, should  tend eventually to  improve the situation and restore a normal rate of profit on the investment.*

## EXPLANATIONS FOR THE CAPITAL CYCLE ANOMALY
> The market inefficiency  observed by  capital  cycle analysis can be explained in terms of the conventional findings of behavioural finance – namely, some combination of  overconfidence, base-rate neglect,  cognitive  dissonance, narrow-framing and extrapolation appear  to  account for the fact that  companies  with  high  levels  of  investment  tend  to  underperform

## COMPETITION  NEGLECT
> failure to  pay attention to  the outward shift in  the supply curve can be linked to  another common  behavioural trait,  known as  “base-rate neglect.” Namely, the tendency of people not to take into account all available information when making a decision. With regards to the workings of the capital  cycle, investors focus on  current (and  projected) future  profitability but ignore  changes in  the industry’s  asset base from  which returns are  generated.  At  times,  this  tendency  morphs  into  what  psychologists  call “cognitive dissonance” – a wilful refusal to consider disconfirming evidence once a course of  action  has been decided upon.

## INSIDE  VIEW
> An  inside view considers a problem by  focusing on  the specific task and the information at  hand, and predicts  based on  that unique set of  inputs. This is the approach analysts  most often use in their modeling, and indeed is common for all forms of planning. In  contrast, an  outside view considers the problem as  an instance in  a broader reference class. Rather than  seeing the problem as unique, the outside view asks if there are similar situations that  can provide useful  calibration for modeling. Kahneman notes this is a very  unnatural way to  think precisely because it forces  analysts  to  set aside all of  the cherished information they have  unearthed about  a company.  This is why people use the outside view so rarely.

## EXTRAPOLATION
> the tendency to  draw strong inferences from small samples. These weaknesses reinforce the propensity of  investors to  make linear  forecasts, despite the fact that  most economic activity is cyclical – there are trade cycles, credit cycles, liquidity cycles, real  estate cycles, profit  cycles, commodity cycles, venture capital cycles  and,  of  course, industry  capital  cycles.

> Value investors who buy cheap stocks with  depressed earnings are protected against the extrapolation tendency. As the author of a recent investment  text book writes: 
> 
> The main  behavioral  explanation for value stocks’ long-run  outperformance is excessive extrapolation by  investors of  multiyear growth rates.  In  reality,  growth  mean  reverts  faster  than  the  market  expects, making growth stocks more likely to disappoint.

## SKEWED INCENTIVES
> CEO compensation is often linked to short-term performance measures, such as  annual  changes in  earnings-per-share  or  shareholder returns.  Stock prices  often react positively to  announcements of  major capital  spending.29  Companies which invest more often attract premium valuations. The stocks of  high  asset growth  companies often exhibit positive momentum.30 Executive pay is also frequently linked to a company’s size, as measured by revenue or market capitalization. The incentives are thus skewed for managers to favour growth and to downplay any adverse long-term consequences


## PRISONER’S  DILEMMA
> Game theory  can also explain overinvestment  within  an  industry. Managers in a business with high current profitability may face a problem akin to the prisoner’s dilemma. Take a situation where future demand growth can profitably accommodate expansion by a single player, but no more. If several players simultaneously expand their operations, their aggregate profits will decline at  some  future  date. Under such circumstances,  it’s  collectively rational for the incumbents to prevent any expansion – since gains only accrue to one of their number. If the industry is competitive or has low barriers to entry,  there is  an  incentive for one player to  break ranks and enjoy the fruits of expansion. The remainder may feel obliged to follow suit, as they can’t abide a competitor  leaving them standing and may wish to  protect market share. Thus, excessive asset growth  can result  from  a lack of  cooperative behaviour within  an  industry

## LIMITS  TO  ARBITRAGE
> fast-growing companies often have  volatile  share prices  and going short volatility  can be very  expensive – as short-sellers  of  Internet  and  technology  stocks  discovered  to  their  cost  in  the late 1990s.  Furthermore, companies with  strong asset growth  often have  large market capitalizations – as  was the case with  many  of  the telecoms companies in  the 1990s and more  recently with  the global  mining stocks.

## ANALYZE  COMPETITIVE  CONDITIONS  WITHIN  AN  INDUSTRY
> From the investment perspective, the key point is that returns are driven by changes on the supply side. A firm’s profitability comes under threat when the competitive conditions are deteriorating. The negative phase of the capital cycle is characterized by industry fragmentation and increasing supply. The aim of  capital  cycle analysis is to  spot these developments in  advance of  the market. New entrants  noisily trumpet their arrival in  an  industry. A rash of  IPOs concentrated in  a hot sector is a red flag; secondary share issuances another,  as  are increases in  debt.  Conversely, a focus on  competitive conditions should  alert investors to  opportunities where supply conditions are benign and companies are able to maintain profitability for longer than the market expects. An  understanding of  competitive conditions and supply side dynamics also helps investors avoid value traps

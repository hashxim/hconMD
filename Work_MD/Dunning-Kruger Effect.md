`Summary`

# Introduction
The Dunning-Kruger effect is a type of [cognitive bias](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-a-cognitive-bias-2794963) in which ==people believe that they are smarter and more capable than they really are. Essentially, low ability people do not possess the skills needed to recognize their own incompetence.== The combination of poor [self-awareness](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-self-awareness-2795023) and low cognitive ability leads them to overestimate their own capabilities.

# Research
David Dunning and Justin Kruger, two social psychologists first described it. They performed series of four investigations:

>People who scored in the lowest percentiles on tests of grammar, humor, and logic also tended to dramatically overestimate how well they had performed (their actual test scores placed them in the 12th percentile, but they estimated that their performance placed them in the 62nd percentile).

Incompetent people, the researchers found, are not only poor performers, they are also unable to accurately assess and recognize the quality of their own work. This is the reason why students who earn failing scores on exams sometimes feel that they deserved a much higher score. They overestimate their own knowledge and ability and are incapable of seeing the poorness of their performance.

## Experiment 1
In one experiment, for example, Dunning and Kruger asked their 65 participants to rate how funny different jokes were. Some of the participants were exceptionally poor at determining what other people would find funnyâ€”yet these same subjects described themselves as excellent judges of humor.

>==Low performers are unable to recognize the skill and competence levels of other people, which is part of the reason why they consistently view themselves as better, more capable, and more knowledgeable than others.==

## Experiment 2
This effect can have a profound impact on what people believe, the decisions they make, and the actions they take.

In [one study](https://doi.org/10.1037/e633872013-215), Dunning and Ehrlinger found that women performed equally to men on a science quiz, and yet women underestimated their performance because they believed they had less scientific reasoning ability than men. As a result to this belief, these women were more likely to refuse to enter science competition.

## Experiment 3
Dunning and his colleagues asked respondents if they are familiar with variety of terms related to subjects - politics, biology, physics and geography. The terms also included made-up terms too. Approximately, 90 percent of respondents claimed that they had at least some knowledge of made-up terms.

# Causes of the effect
Dunning and Kruger suggest that this phenomenon stems from what they refer to as a "dual burden." People are not only incompetent; their incompetence robs them of the mental ability to realize just how inept they are.

Incompetent people tend to:

-   Overestimate their own skill levels
-   Fail to recognize the genuine skill and expertise of other people
-   Fail to recognize their own mistakes and lack of skill

==Dunning has pointed out that the very knowledge and skills necessary to be good at a task are the exact same qualities that a person needs to recognize that they are not good at that task. So if a person lacks those abilities, they remain not only bad at that task but ignorant to their own inability.==

## Inability to Recognize lack of Skill and Mistakes
Deficits in skill and expertise create a two-pronged problem. First, these deficits cause people to perform poorly in the domain in which they are incompetent. Secondly, their erroneous and deficient knowledge makes them unable to recognize their mistakes.

## A Little Knowledge can lead to Overconfidence
A tiny bit of knowledge on a subject can lead people to mistakenly believe that they know all there is to know about it.

Other factors that can contribute to the effect include our use of [heuristics](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-a-heuristic-2795235), or mental shortcuts that allow us to make decisions quickly, and our tendency to seek out patterns even where none exist. Our minds are primed to try to make sense of the disparate array of information we deal with on a daily basis. As we try to cut through the confusion and interpret our own abilities and performance within our individual worlds, it is perhaps not surprising that we sometimes fail so completely to accurately judge how well we do.

# Who is affected?
We all are. No matter how informed or experienced we are, everyone has areas in which they are uninformed and incompetent. People who are genuine experts in one area may mistakenly believe that their intelligence and knowledge carry over into other areas in which they are less familiar.

So if the incompetent tend to think they are experts, what do genuine experts think of their own abilities? These experts actually tended to underestimate their own abilities relative to how others did.

Essentially, these top-scoring individuals know that they are better than the average, but they are not convinced of just how superior their performance is compared to others.

# Experience - Confidence relation
As experience with a subject increases, confidence typically declines to more realistic levels. As people learn more about the topic of interest, they begin to recognize their own lack of knowledge and ability. Then as people gain more information and actually become experts on a topic, their confidence levels begin to improve once again.

# How to overcome this effect?
- Keep learning and practicing
- Ask other people how you're doing
- Question what you know

# Conclusion
The Dunning-Kruger effect is one of many cognitive biases that can affect your behaviors and decisions, from the mundane to the life-changing. While it may be easier to recognize the phenomenon in others, it is important to remember that it is something that impacts everyone.

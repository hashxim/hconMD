`Summary`

# Introduction
The Dunning-Kruger effect is a type of [cognitive bias](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-a-cognitive-bias-2794963) in which people believe that they are smarter and more capable than they really are. Essentially, low ability people do not possess the skills needed to recognize their own incompetence. The combination of poor [self-awareness](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-self-awareness-2795023) and low cognitive ability leads them to overestimate their own capabilities.

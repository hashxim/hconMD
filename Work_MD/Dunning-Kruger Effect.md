`Summary`

# Introduction
The Dunning-Kruger effect is a type of [cognitive bias](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-a-cognitive-bias-2794963) in which people believe that they are smarter and more capable than they really are. Essentially, low ability people do not possess the skills needed to recognize their own incompetence. The combination of poor [self-awareness](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-self-awareness-2795023) and low cognitive ability leads them to overestimate their own capabilities.

# Research
David Dunning and Justin Kruger, two social psychologists first described it. They performed series of four investigations:

>People who scored in the lowest percentiles on tests of grammar, humor, and logic also tended to dramatically overestimate how well they had performed (their actual test scores placed them in the 12th percentile, but they estimated that their performance placed them in the 62nd percentile).

Incompetent people, the researchers found, are not only poor performers, they are also unable to accurately assess and recognize the quality of their own work. This is the reason why students who earn failing scores on exams sometimes feel that they deserved a much higher score. They overestimate their own knowledge and ability and are incapable of seeing the poorness of their performance.

## Experiment 1
In one experiment, for example, Dunning and Kruger asked their 65 participants to rate how funny different jokes were. Some of the participants were exceptionally poor at determining what other people would find funny—yet these same subjects described themselves as excellent judges of humor.

>==Low performers are unable to recognize the skill and competence levels of other people, which is part of the reason why they consistently view themselves as better, more capable, and more knowledgeable than others.==

## Experiment 2
This effect can have a profound impact on what people believe, the decisions they make, and the actions they take.

In [one study](https://doi.org/10.1037/e633872013-215), Dunning and Ehrlinger found that women performed equally to men on a science quiz, and yet women underestimated their performance because they believed they had less scientific reasoning ability than men. As a result to this belief, these women were more likely to refuse to enter science competition.

## Experiment 3
Dunning and his colleagues asked respondents if they are familiar with variety of terms related to subjects - politics, biology, physics and geography. The terms also included made-up terms too. Approximately, 90 percent of respondents claimed that they had at least some knowledge of made-up terms.

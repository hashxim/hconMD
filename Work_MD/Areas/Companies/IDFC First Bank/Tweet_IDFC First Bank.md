Cost of Funds:
![[IDFC CoF.png]]
As SA rate is 4-5% now, higher cost bonds would be paid back early and CoF will come down.

Summary: Fast growing CASA, Retailization of CASA, reducing interest rates on SA, CASA substituting higher interest borrowings.


# Assets
![[Loans Offered_Bank.png]]

Wholesale assets are corporate loans which are coming down. Bank's objective is to be a retail bank. Wind down infra loans to 0% of book.

IDFC bank has been lending to risky lenders historically but there is transformation in this area.

Mortgage and consumer loans have gone up, SME stable and Microfinance has gone down

**Introduction of Prime Home Loan segment**
Bank has also started reducing saving rate to 4% and started new segment of Prime home loan which is giving home loans to top corporate at low interest rate. This will open up a new and large market with higher asset quality for Bank.

Bank is also reducing risk by reducing credit to first time borrowers and increase in credit to customer with high credit scores. This creates relationship with high income high saving customer. Good cross-selling opportunity, Low NPAs.

## Why the trend will continue?
Bank has lot of money in government securities. Bank has parked excess liquidity compared what is required as per RBI guidelines. This money when disbursed as retail loan, average yield will go up. 

# Profitability
Expanding NIM:
![[IDFC First Expanding NIM.png]]

Drag on Profitability - Asset quality got affected during Covid. Pre Covid - GNPA: 2.6%. Post Covid GNPA: 4.1%. Given that a large part of the book is lending to SME and Micro finance, this looks good.

CEO has guided for long term 2% GNPA [here](https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/banking-finance/we-are-heading-towards-gross-npas-of-2-on-a-sustainable-basis-v-vaidyanathan-md-ceo-idfc-first-bank/2250255/)

**Dive into NPAs:** Infra contributes to half of all wholesale NPAs.

Bank's Interest income was 10000 cr for FY21 but profits only 450 cr since most is eaten up by provisions and CIR.

# Operating Leverage
Bank is expanding fast and it needs to hire employees, build branches. The cost are front-loaded. As OPEX and CAPEX gets amortized over larger AUM and CASA, CIR will come down. This has happened in Capital First.
![[IDFC First CIR.png]]

The OPEX will grow slower than AUM/CASA and operating leverage will play out.
![[IDFC First OPEX.png]]

Due to above reason, retail segment shows constant losses right now.

# Cross Selling
Bank has launched credit card business. Innovative one, bank will charge lower interest rate depending on one's credit profile.
![[IDFC First Credit Card.png]]

9-15% interest for short term. No interest on short term cash withdrawals. Even reward points are better than HDFC bank.

# Management
Management has its own score card every quarter. QoQ they show progress on goals.
![[IDFC First Scorecard 1.png]]

Bank has also recognized Vodafone Idea as stressed asset (~3% of book) and created 50% provision when SC AGR dues judgement came. Not many banks did this aggressively.

When they state profits, they focus on calling out one-offs and state without one-offs. 

Bank proactively reveals the stressed book (non-NPA but chances of it becoming NPA). Stressed book has been degrowing but provisions for stressed book (Bank is creating provisions for them is conservative, pro-active lending)

![[IDFC First Stressed Book.png]]

CEO has said in multiple interviews that they would never delay recognizing an asset as NPA. 

# Risks
- Bank has to follow conservative underwriting process, else NPAs would blow up and eat into NIM
- Few years of low profitability as they expand branches and OPEX grows without significant loan book growth (Infra loans are wound down)
- Any short term pain (Covid)

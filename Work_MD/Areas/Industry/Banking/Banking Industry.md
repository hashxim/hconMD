`Summary`

# How Banks work
## Liability Side
Bank raise money through (Input):
- Customer deposits
- Borrowing (Issue Bond, Take loan from other banks etc.)

Since bank is liable to pay interest, it is known as liabilities.

This is important as it is cheap money since bank offer low savings account rate and 0% current account rate. This is called CASA. Bank need to do advertising and brand building to develop trust and build CASA. Another thing they can do is to attract customer with high Savings Account (SA) interest rate.

**Granular Liability** - Bank wants to make liability granular (small deposits by many customers). This makes the liability more sticky and less prone to change.

Bank would also like to substitute higher interest borrowing with CASA.


## Asset Side
Bank gives loan to (Output):
- Customers (Retail and Corporate)
- Subscription to bonds (GoI, Corporate)

Since these generate income, they are called assets.

Not all liabilities can be used to purchase bond or give loans because banks need to have enough liquidityxb to service redemption of their deposits.

Wholesale assets are corporate loans (large ticket size, high risk like infra loans).
Retail loans are low risk.

# Key Terms
- **NIM (Net Interest Margin)** - It is the interest earned minus interest outgo as proportion of interest earning assets.
- **Spread** - Difference between interest rate for assets and interest rate for liabilities
- **Other Costs** - Cost of running branches, money paid to employees, sales and marketing campaigns etc.
- **Cost of Funds (CoF)** - Weighted average interest rate of interest bearing liabilities. 


# Metrics to Track
- **Return on Assets (RoA)** - This tells how profitable the bank is as proportion to its total assets (which includes the debt it takes)
- **Return on Equity (RoE)** - Tells profitability as proportion to its equity only.

## Drag to Profitability
- **Cost to Income ration (CIR)** - Operating expenses / Operating income generated (Net interest income + other income). This tracks its operating efficiency.
- **Gross NPA** - This tracks its lending efficiency. 
	- Any non-payment of EMI for 90 days, it becomes NPA
	- To fill this hole, bank has to set aside profits. These are known as **provisions**. 
	- What is left after partially filling through provisions is called Net NPA (NNPA)

## Boost to Profitability
- Can do cross selling by boosting its non-lending income.
	- Sell credit cards
	- Sell Insurance
	- Sell Mutual Funds
	- Create Insurance / MF arm and manage assets

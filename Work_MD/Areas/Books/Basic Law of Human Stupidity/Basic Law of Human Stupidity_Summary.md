# Introduction
The book is result of constructive effort to detect, know and possibly neutralize one of the dark forces that hinder the growth of human welfare and Happiness

# Chapter 1: The First Basic Law
>"**Always and inevitably everyone underestimates the number of stupid individuals in circulation.**"

>"No matter how high are one’s estimates of human stupidity, one is repeatedly and recurrently startled by the fact that 
> - people whom one had once judged rational and intelligent turn out to be unashamedly stupid; 
> - day after day, with unceasing monotony, one is harassed in one’s activities by stupid individuals who appear suddenly and unexpectedly in the most inconvenient places and at the most improbable moments."

# Chapter 2: The Second Basic Law
> "It is my firm conviction, supported by years of observation and experimentation, that men are not equal, that some are stupid and others are not and that the difference is determined by nature and not by cultural forces or factors"

> "**The probability that a certain person be stupid is independent of any other characteristic of that person.**"

Nature ensures that frequency of stupidity is equal to probability σ and is independent of group size

> "Whether I considered a large university or a small college, a famous institution or an obscure one, I found that the same fraction σ of the professors were stupid. So bewildered was I by the results that I made a special point to extend my research to a specially selected group, to a real elite, the Nobel laureates. The result confirmed Nature’s supreme powers: σ fraction of the Nobel laureates were stupid"

# Technical Interlude

`Summary`

# Introduction
Two School of thoughts on how to approach extreme phases:
- Markets can get extremely expensive or cheap, but these phases are extremely difficult to identify except in hindsight. Thus, market movement cannot be predicted
- Based on certain parameters, extremes can be identified and asset allocation should be adjusted accordingly. Although this sounds appealing, its super difficult to pull off consistently

Author's approach is blend of both. 
>I won’t be taking any extreme positions. All-In or All-Out allocations from Equities will be avoided. But I will try to do some adjustments (but nothing drastic)

There are 3 parts of it:
- Regular Rebalancing
- Bear Market Plan
- Bubble Market Plan

# Regular Rebalancing
>**Each year you review your portfolio, and if any asset class allocation exceeds or falls short by 5% of original intended allocation, you bring it back to original levels.**

Backtests indicate roughly around 1-1.5% improvement in returns by doing this simple activity.

[Research](https://www.vanguardfrance.fr/documents/best-practices-for-portfolio-rebalancing-tlrv.pdf) also shows that returns are not meaningfully different whether a portfolio is rebalanced monthly, quarterly, or annually.

>**So in terms of rebalancing frequency you can either choose to do it once a year or once every 6 months (but be mindful of tax & exit load implications).**

# Bear Market Plan
To be addressed in a separate post

# Bubble Market Plan
Bubble market means that equity market is super expensive and any negative event can cause market to crash. This thought argues for much lower allocation to equities than original allocation.

However, concern here is:
- Bubble market can go for a long time (sometimes several years) and its frustrating if you are completely out of the market
- Calling bubble market top is super difficult

and recent crash

>**To balance both the above factors, I would suggest not reducing the equity allocation below half of your original equity allocation**.

Author would suggest going underweight in two tranches:
- **Trigger 1**: Reduce to 75% of original equity allocation
- **Trigger 2**: Reduce to 50% of original equity allocation

How to decide when to go underweight on equities:

>**Next 5Y Equity Returns = Change in Earnings + Change in Valuation (Price to Earnings multiple) + Dividend Yield**

## Approach for Valuation
History shows that valuation doesn't stay extremely expensive or cheap for a long time and revert back to mean.

Indicators to evaluate valuations:
- Price to Earning Ratio
- Price to Book Ratio
- Market Cap to GDP Ratio

Based on the evaluation of the above 3 with respect to historical averages, you can take a stance on where the valuations are – High or Moderate or Low


## Approach for Earning Growth
Idea id to find out where we are in earning cycle. History shows that equity market go through periods of strong earnings growth followed by weak earnings growth and again cycles continues.

Factors to look at:
-   Past Earnings Growth
-   ROE Cycle
-   Corporate Profits to GDP
-   Interest Rates
-   Credit Growth
-   Capacity Utilization
-   Other Factors – Oil Price, Government reforms etc

Based on the evaluation of the above factors with respect to history, you can take a stance on where we are in the earnings growth cycle – Bottom of Earnings Growth Cycle or Middle of Earnings Cycle or Top of Earnings Cycle

## Putting it together
![[Bubble Market Trigger Matrix.png]]

**Trigger 1 (underweight to 75% of original allocation) to happen, these are the scenarios:**
-   **Scenario 1:** Top of Earnings Cycle + Moderate Valuations
-   **Scenario 2:** High Valuations + Moderate Earnings Cycle
-   **Scenario 3:** Extremely High Valuations + Bottom of Earnings Cycle

**Trigger 2 (underweight to 50% of original allocation) to happen, these are the scenarios:**
-   **Condition 1:** Top of Earnings Cycle
-   **Condition 2:** High Valuations

# How to build framework?
Since author is part of big firm, he has luxury to track a lot more factors to take decision (~25 factors). But for normal investor, here is some jugaad (makeshift)

## Trigger 1: Use valuation as an indicator
Consider it as High Valuation when 2/3 conditions are satisfied:
1.  Equity Allocation of ICICI Balanced Advantage Fund <45%
2.  Equity Allocation of Kotak Balanced Advantage Fund <40%
3.  MCAP/GDP>100%

ICICI Balanced Advantage Fund runs asset allocation based on P/B Ratio. Kotak Balanced Advantage Fund runs asset allocation bases on P/E Ratio. Check MCAP/GDP from [here](https://www2.slideshare.net/iciciprumf?utm_campaign=profiletracking&utm_medium=sssite&utm_source=ssslideview)


## Trigger 2: Trigger 1 + Top of Earning Cycle
-   **Condition 1:** Trigger 1 has already been triggered
-   **Condition 2:** Top of Earnings Growth Cycle

How to check for top earning growth cycle?
-   Last 5 year earnings growth
-   Corporate PAT/GDP
-   Nifty ROE

If all three are close to their highs (with respect to long term history), it implies that we are close to the top of earnings cycle.

# How to go Underweight?
Markets can continue to rally despite of high valuations (US in last 10 years). One needs to be really cautious while going underweight.

So instead of going underweight equities (reducing exposure), go underweight using Dynamic Asset Allocation funds (also called Balanced Advantage Funds). So when Trigger 1 happens, one would move 1/4 of equities out to Balanced Fund. 

This is adding extra layer of security (apart from debt in the portfolio) since Balanced Fund automatically increases and decreases equity allocation based on valuation.

## How to bring back to original allocation?
2 conditions have to be satisfied to indicate that allocation needs to be back to original plan:
- **Condition 1**: Kotak BAF equity allocation goes above 60%
- **Condition 2**: ICICI Prudential BAF goes above 65%

If you panic and not able to increase allocation in market fall, Balanced fund will automatically increase the equity allocation.

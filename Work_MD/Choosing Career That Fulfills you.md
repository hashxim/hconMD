`Summary`

# Common approaches that DOESN'T work
- **Choosing career based on financial gain** - Choosing not because of interest in actual work but because of the financial opportunity available. One doesn't look at the culture of these companies, career path, work-life balance, day-to-day tasks, personality type needed. 
- **Thinking Entrepreneurship as the only perfect career** - Full time isn't for everyone. ==We have been sold this narrative that 9-5 can only be soul-sucking which is not true==. One may want to have balance of entrepreneurship as side business while still have a full-time job. You don't need to quit to start your own business.
- **Not looking deep enough into yourself before job searching** -

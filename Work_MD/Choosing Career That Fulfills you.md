`Summary`

# Common approaches that DOESN'T work
- **Choosing career based on financial gain** - Choosing not because of interest in actual work but because of the financial opportunity available. One doesn't look at the culture of these companies, career path, work-life balance, day-to-day tasks, personality type needed. 
- **Thinking Entrepreneurship as the only perfect career** - Full time isn't for everyone. ==We have been sold this narrative that 9-5 can only be soul-sucking which is not true==. One may want to have balance of entrepreneurship as side business while still have a full-time job. You don't need to quit to start your own business.
- **Not looking deep enough into yourself before job searching** - You need to spend as much time as needed selecting the right career to target before starting the actual job search. When you care about your work, you show up more fully in all areas of your life.

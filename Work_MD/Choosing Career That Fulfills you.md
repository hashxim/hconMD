`Summary`

# Common approaches that DOESN'T work
- **Choosing career based on financial gain** - Choosing not because of interest in actual work but because of the financial opportunity available. One doesn't look at the culture of these companies, career path, work-life balance, day-to-day tasks, personality type needed. 
- **Thinking Entrepreneurship as the only perfect career** - Full time isn't for everyone. ==We have been sold this narrative that 9-5 can only be soul-sucking which is not true==. One may want to have balance of entrepreneurship as side business while still have a full-time job. You don't need to quit to start your own business.
- **Not looking deep enough into yourself before job searching** - You need to spend as much time as needed selecting the right career to target before starting the actual job search. When you care about your work, you show up more fully in all areas of your life.

## Preferred Work Style
Do you prefer structure or do you prefer lots of blank space without much guidance?
Do you prefer to work closely with others or prefer autonomy?
Do you need lot of variety or prefer working on one thing only?

## Identify good at
Find what you're good at, what you enjoy, what pays well, what's needed in the world. Make list. 

Do some research into careers and industries that include the things you enjoy doing. Learn what the industry pay rates and lifestyle it offers.

See if the cause or company is working toward something meaningful and that aligns with what’s needed in the world.

## Research and try as many career ideas as possible
Once you have few ideas of careers that you would feel purposeful and aligned with, begin to try them. Begin to feel what it would be like to have this career. Make it part of your identity, add to LinkedIn title.

Research any training for your new career. Connect with few people in the industry and get to know day to day operations and responsibilities. 

Don't worry about how it looks on outside and what other people think.

## Talk to as many people as Possible
Start connecting with people that are in your desired job. LinkedIn is a great place for that.

By setting up 20-minute calls with questions prepared, you start to get a good feel of learning the good and bad parts of the career you’re researching: What you’re willing to live with as well as what you're not. You can really learn a lot from talking with people about what they like and don’t like in their careers to see if that applies to you.

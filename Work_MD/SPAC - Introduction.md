Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPAC) also known as Blank check companies offer private businesses a fast-track to going public that bypasses traditional IPO Process.

## Criticism
- Investors can get into a company and then get burned. They wont have enough time to access if a company is legitimate and there is even risk of fraud.

## Advantages
- SPAC gives you an opportunity to invest in good management team where you have confidence on them to do some sort of profitable deal which increases the value of the investment. But its a risk (similar to writing blank check) as you don't know if they will do a good deal or not.

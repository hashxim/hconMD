Over the last 2 years
controversial companies, SPACs are getting more popular. The activity has already quadrupled in 2020. Some investors say its an efficient way for companies to go public but critics say it allows for backdoor deals.


# Definition
Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPAC) also known as Blank check companies offer private businesses a fast-track to going public that bypasses traditional IPO Process. 
SPACs are public shell companies that exist for single purpose - finding a private company and taking it to a market quickly.

## History
In early days in 1980s, the precursor of today's SPACs were called blind pools. They had shady reputation tied to Penny-stock frauds. But in new age, laws and regulations helped add credibility and bolster investor confidence. 

More blue-chip institutions like Goldman Sachs never used to SPAC IPOs but in 2016 it did its first SPAC IPO. NYSE now lists a lot of SPAC.

## How SPACs work
In order to take company public, a SPAC will merge with the private company. The company then get a spot in the exchange and a **new ticker**. After merger, investor who own shares in the blank check company now owns a piece of the new entity and the founders of the SPAC get a large part of it too. SPACs are mostly owned by veteran corporate leaders and big investors, private equity firms and usually smaller amount of shares are available for the public.

For companies going public, SPAC offer different approach than traditional IPOs:

- **Traditional IPOs**
	- Private company works with underwriter / investment banks to work out a deal and then takes the company public. The process can take months and under traditional IPO rules, the private company must stay quiet and refrain from promoting its shares. 
	- IPOs get derailed at last minute all the time. 
- **SPAC**
	- SPAC have big advantage in terms of promoting shares. They can talk about themselves and promote themselves to investors.
	- SPAC provide certainty of the deal at difficult times like pandemic. When markets are volatile, through traditional IPOs, private companies doesn't want to go public. 

## Current Situation

In 2020, Bill Ackman launched the biggest SPAC ever. It can take very, very large company public.

## Criticism
- Investors can get into a company and then get burned. They wont have enough time to access if a company is legitimate and there is even risk of fraud.
- Critics says that companies going public through SPAC does not get enough scrutiny as those traditional IPOs.
	- Example - Nikola which went public through SPAC. It had turned out to be a centre of firestorm of fraud allegations. Traditional IPO lovers would say that company would have gone through trad

## Advantages
- SPAC gives you an opportunity to invest in good management team where you have confidence on them to do some sort of profitable deal which increases the value of the investment. But its a risk (similar to writing blank check) as you don't know if they will do a good deal or not.

Over the last 2 years
controversial companies, SPACs are getting more popular. The activity has already quadrupled in 2020. Some investors say its an efficient way for companies to go public but critics say it allows for backdoor deals.


# Definition
Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPAC) also known as Blank check companies offer private businesses a fast-track to going public that bypasses traditional IPO Process. 
SPACs are public shell companies that exist for single purpose - finding a private company and taking it to a market quickly.
## How SPACs work
In order to take company public, a SPAC will merge with the private company. The company then get a spot in the exchange and a **new ticker**. After merger, investor who own shares in the blank check company now owns a piece of the new entity and the founders of the SPAC get a large part of it too. SPACs are mostly owned by veteran corporate leaders and big investors, private equity firms and usually smaller amount of shares are available for the public. 

For companies going public, SPAC offer different approach than traditional IPOs:

- Traditional IPOs
Private company works with underwriter / investment banks to work out a deal and then takes the company public. The process can take months and under traditional IPO rules, the private company must stay quiet and refrain from promoting its shares. 

### SPAC
SPAC have big advantage in terms of promoting shares. They can talk about themselves and promote themselves to investors

## Criticism
- Investors can get into a company and then get burned. They wont have enough time to access if a company is legitimate and there is even risk of fraud.

## Advantages
- SPAC gives you an opportunity to invest in good management team where you have confidence on them to do some sort of profitable deal which increases the value of the investment. But its a risk (similar to writing blank check) as you don't know if they will do a good deal or not.

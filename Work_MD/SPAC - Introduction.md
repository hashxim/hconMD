Over the last 2 years
controversial companies, SPACs are getting more popular. The activity has already quadrupled in 2020. Some investors say its an efficient way for companies to go public but critics say it allows for backdoor deals.


# Definition
Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPAC) also known as Blank check companies offer private businesses a fast-track to going public that bypasses traditional IPO Process. 
SPACs are public shell companies that exist for single purpose - finding a private company and taking it to a market quickly.
## How SPACs work
In order to take company public, a SPAC will merge with the private company. The company then get a spot in the exchange and a **new ticker**. After merger, investor who own shares in the blank check company now owns a piece of the new entity and the founders of the SPAC get a large part of it too.

## Criticism
- Investors can get into a company and then get burned. They wont have enough time to access if a company is legitimate and there is even risk of fraud.

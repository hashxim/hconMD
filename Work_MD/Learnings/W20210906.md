# Day Summary 
## 20210906
- Neha moving day. Most of the day spent on helping in moving stuff.
- Weekly Catchup with Preeti 
	- I requested to move meeting from 3PM to anytime before 12PM. Meeting happened at 10AM
	- Started with telling her about my holiday in Peak District and Champneys
	- Major topic picked was Chris being asking to look for PowerApps developer in LatAm.
	- Preeti is not comfortable with having resource in LatAm due to multiple reasons - time difference, Language barrier etc
	- She asked what should be our argument against this to Chris
		- I pointed out 2 options 
			- Either continue with the current model and slow down the system and carry the risk of single point of failure
			- Hire someone who could lower the risk by sharing knowledge with me and could help and support the apps in my absence.
	- We also briefly discussed about my current position in company and if I am evaluating to leave the company. I said that considering how much a developer is getting outside, I should be paid way more than I am actually getting
	- Preeti also mentioned that she has asked HR for my salary details
	- She also would like to have some kind of a budget so that she has free hand to decide what she would like to do in her role and manage different resources
	- We moved to talk about MS Amlin. I gave her demo of 1st iteration that has been pushed to UAT environment.
	- I also introduced her to automation that I am running for Beazley UW on weekly basis and how it make my job easy to monitor things. I told her this is how we would be tackling things in future once we have a lot of things to manage.


## 20210907
- Weekly PowerApps Catchup
	- Preeti is busy with something, Will and Ryan are on leave. Louis and I were the only ones in the meeting.
	- He wanted to discuss about the approach we will follow to tackle with resourcing issue. I said the same thing I discussed with Preeti on different options we would present to Chris
	- Moved to Amlin where I asked him whether PowerApps for Teams has been enabled for project team. He confirmed that it has been enabled but I should wait as Claire might have not sent the team an email letting them know that they will be testing an app.
	- Discussed that Will had captured the reporting requirements and it has been signed off. The report would be in 3 parts - report for the client that is to be presented, report for the internal tracking and the report that client actually uses.

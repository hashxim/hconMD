- Meeting with Preeti
	- Updated her on development of MS Amlin
	- Told her about my upcoming discussion with Will on SLA
	- Discussed on my call with Hannah last week and what she suggested on using free consultants as developers. I told how this is not a good strategy and she agreed.
	- I told her that I am having a meeting with Chris this week and she mentioned why I am skipping Louis, Will, her and talking directly to Chris. I told what i plan to discus and to move things forward.
	- We also discussed what Hannah mentioned about selection of projects and how strategy should decide next projects. Preeti didn't agree with that as there needs to be demand for PowerApps for us to implement.
	- On Audit, I mentioned that Hannah may like to get that approved soon and also may like to get prioritized above HWI. 
	- Preeti also asked Hannah what her role is or on what she is working on and she had a very fancy sentence sent back to her where she said she is acting as an advisor on different verticals and executives.
	- She asked I should not discuss a lot of details with Chris but ask questions more.

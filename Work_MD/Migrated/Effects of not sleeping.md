`Sleep is important for our daily functioning. During sleep, accumulated waste in brain and in cells gets cleared up. Constant sleep deprivation can lead to very serious issues. `

## Sleep Requirement
Adults:  7-8 hours of sleep a night 
Adolescents: 10 hours

## Effect of Sleep deprivation
Some of the effects of sleep deprivation:
- Eyes stopped focusing 
- Losing the ability to identify objects by touch
- Moody and uncoordinated
- Struggling to concentrate
- Having trouble with short-term memory
- Becoming paranoid
- Hallucination 
- Inflammation
- Hormonal imbalance
- High blood pressure
- Linked to diabetes and obesity 
- Illness
- Extreme cases: Death

 Studies show that chronically sleeping fewer than six hours a night increases stroke risk by four and half times compared to those getting a consistent seven to eight hours of shuteye. 

## When we sleep?
We grow sleepy due to signals from our body telling our brain we are tired, and signals from the environment telling us it's dark outside. 

**The rise in sleep-inducing chemicals, like adenosine and melatonin, send us into a light doze  that grows deeper, making our breathing and heart rate slow down and our muscles relax.** This non-REM sleep is when DNA is repaired and our bodies replenish themselves for the day ahead. 

## Sleeplessness
For a handful of people on the planet who carry a rare inherited genetic mutation, sleeplessness is a daily reality. 

This condition, known as **Fatal Familial Insomnia,** places the body in a nightmarish state of wakefulness, forbidding it from entering the sanctuary of sleep. Within months or years, this progressively worsening condition leads to dementia and death. 

### Causes of immense suffering from sleep deprivation
Scientists think it has to do with the accumulation of waste products in the brain. During our waking hours, **our cells are busy using up our day's energy sources, which get broken down into various by-products, including adenosine**. 

**As adenosine builds up, it increases the urge to sleep, also known as sleep pressure**. In fact, caffeine works by blocking adenosine's receptor pathways. Other waste products also build up in the brain, and if they're not cleared away, they collectively overload the brain and are thought to lead to the many negative symptoms of sleep deprivation. 

## What happens in brain when we sleep?
Scientists found something called the glymphatic system, a clean-up mechanism that removes this buildup and is much more active when we're asleep. It works by using **cerebrospinal fluid to flush away toxic by-products that accumulate between cells**. **Lymphatic vessels, which serve as pathways for immune cells, have recently been discovered in the brain, and they may also play a role in clearing out the brain's daily waste products**. 

While scientists continue exploring the restorative mechanisms behind sleep, we can be sure that slipping into slumber is a necessity if we want to maintain our health and our sanity.

## Sleep data in US
It's estimated that 30% of adults and 66% of adolescents are regularly sleep-deprived.

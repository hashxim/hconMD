`Major categories of disorders as per latest edition of DSM-5 diagnostic manual`

# Definition
Behaviors that are considered maladaptive and cause significant personal distress and interrupt daily functioning are more likely to be labeled as disorders.

A psychological disorder is a designation often used interchangeably with the terms mental disorder, psychiatric disorder, or mental illness.

The official term defined in the latest edition of American Psychiatric Association's diagnostic manual is:

>...a syndrome characterized byâ€‹ a clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognitive, emotion regulation, or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological, or developmental process underlying mental functioning. Mental disorders are usually associated with significant distress in social, occupational, or other important activities. 

## Exception
The DSM-5 also notes that expected responses to a common stressor such as the death of a loved one are not considered mental disorders. The diagnostic manual also suggests that behaviors that are often considered at odds with social norms are not considered disorders unless these actions are the result of some dysfunction.

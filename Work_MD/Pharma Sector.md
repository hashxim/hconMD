# Risks
- **Regulated**
	- Compliance requirement unique to each geography
	- Greater source of risk than financials since **non-compliance not just include fines but involve blanket bans on productions facilities**
	- This can put exports from productions facilities indefinitely in hold
- **Product to Market lifecycle** - Cost involved to bring a **New Chemical Entity (NCE** to market is long and prohibitive. Time can run in decades and cost on average up to $500m. 
	- Regulators can derail the investment at any stage and lead to costly write off
	- Marketplace may also change

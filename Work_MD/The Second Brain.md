`Summary`

Concept is you build a Second Brain which is a digital note taking system which is whatever you read, watch, listen which resonates with you and then you can use your second brain to organize your ideas and ultimately will convert them into creative output. 

This will cover 10 fundamental principals of building a second brain:

## Principle 1:  Borrowed Creativity
We all think creativity as creating original stuff.

Creativity is all about remixing stuff.

## Principle 2: Capture Habit
 Our brains are for having ideas and not for storing them. So whenever we get an idea or anything that resonates with us,  we want to capture that idea as soon as possible as our brains will not going to hold on to it for very long bit. 

## Principle 3: Idea Recycling
Ideas are not for single use but we can recycle ideas over time and based on whatever note taking system we are using, we want to keep track of all the stuff we are creating and reuse them when you are working on something.

## Principle 4: Projects over Categories
People use to categorize and save notes folder wise (Marketing, Productivity etc) but then have no idea about how to use it. So instead of that, think in terms of projects. 

So initially when note is created, it will go into a common inbox

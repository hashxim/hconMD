`Summary`

Concept is you build a Second Brain which is a digital note taking system which is whatever you read, watch, listen which resonates with you and then you can use your second brain to organize your ideas and ultimately will convert them into creative output. 

This will cover 10 fundamental principals of building a second brain:

## Principle 1:  Borrowed Creativity
We all think creativity as creating original stuff.

Creativity is all about remixing stuff.

## Principle 2: Capture Habit
 Our brains are for having ideas and not for storing them. So whenever we get an idea or anything that resonates with us,  we want to capture that idea as soon as possible as our brains will not going to hold on to it for very long bit. 

## Principle 3: Idea Recycling
Ideas are not for single use but we can recycle ideas over time and based on whatever note taking system we are using, we want to keep track of all the stuff we are creating and reuse them when you are working on something.

## Principle 4: Projects over Categories
People use to categorize and save notes folder wise (Marketing, Productivity etc) but then have no idea about how to use it. So instead of that, think in terms of projects. 

So initially when note is created, it will go into a common inbox but then I try to link it to some kind of project I am currently working on or will work on. So in this way, that information will be directly useful rather than lying there like a bookmark.

## Principle 5:  Slow Burns
Most of the things I do are slow burns rather than heavy lifts. For example, you want to write a  book or an online course, and you think I will go to my cabin in the woods and sit down and do all the work in a small amount of time. So this is like a heavy lift which you have to do in one go. 

Opposite of heavy lifts is slow burns. Main idea is we have list of projects and all are on slow burner. So instead of doing a big project one at a time, I am doing all the 10 projects in very small amounts and so integrating it together would be easy. 

## Principle 6: Start with Abundance
 When you have to create anything or write anything or presentation, you dont start with blank page. You must have collected notes or sources over time and this is called abundance.  You just need to search for the keyword and it will give you results from notes you have taken or annotated or read or saved.

## Principle 7: Intermediate Packets
Everything you create is a collection of intermediate Packets which can be re-used again in other projects. 

## Principle 8: You only know what you make
When we engage with the material itself (writing summary of the book, writing tweet storm from podcast etc.) rather than relying on pre-existing material, we end up becoming much more familiar with it. Whatever you read or listen, make notes as that will act as treasure trove for your future work.

## Principle 9: Make it easier for your future self
 Notes created  currently would be consumed by future self. Try to make it easy to get idea about what you were thinking about when you created this note, reason behind writing this note and easy to understand (in your own words)

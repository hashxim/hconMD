`Summary`

A sensation so overwhelming, many people mistake it for heart attack, stroke or other life threatening crisis. 

Though panic attacks don't cause long-term physical harm afterwards, the fear of another attack can limit someone's daily life and cause more panic attack.

Atleast 1/3 of us will experience atleast one panic attack in out lives. 

## What is Panic Attack?
At its core, it is an overreaction to the body's  normal physiological response to the perception of danger. This response starts at the **Amygdala** (region of brain involved in processing fear). When Amygdala perceives danger, it stimulates the **sympathetic nervous system** which triggers release of **adrenaline**. Adrenaline causes increase  in heart (hyperventilation) and breathing rate to get blood and oxygen to muscles of arms and legs. This also sends more oxygen to the brain which makes it more alert and responsive. The changes to blood flow causes lightheadedness and numbness in hands and feet. 

A panic attack usually peaks within 10 minutes. Then, the prefrontal cortex takes over the amygdala and stimulates **parasympathetic nervous system**. This releases hormone called **acetylcholine** that decreases the heart rate and winds down panic attack. 

## Reason
We don't know for sure why this happens. But sometimes cues in the environment that reminds us of traumatic past experience can trigger panic attack. 

Panic attack can be part of anxiety disorder like PTSD, social anxiety disorder, OCD and generalized anxiety disorder. 

## Treatment
2 main treatment for panic disorder
- Antidepressant medication
- Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)

Both have about 40% response rate (someone who may respond to one may not respond to the other). However, **antidepressant medication has some side effects and 50% of people relapse when they stop taking them** 

CBT is more lasting with only 20% relapse rate. The goal of CBT for panic disorder is to help people learn and practice concrete tools to exert physical and in turn mental

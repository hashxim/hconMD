Look for earnings growth
Earning growth is the best defence if you enter into a high valuation stock
Easier to find earning doubler in non-large cap space. For top 100 companies, they are already dominant in their space. Now they will grow at nominal GDP growth of 10-11% and for them deviate from nominal GDP growth is extremely difficult because those are the ones who are making nominal GDP. So its very difficult for the large cap who form 70% of the MCap to deviate from normal GDP growth. 

It is extremely difficult for companies to remain dominant over a decade. When one looks at top 100 companies, they are looking at companies who were dominant in last decade. Investors have to look for companies who will become dominate in next decade.

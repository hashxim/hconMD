Look for earnings growth
Earning growth is the best defence if you enter into a high valuation stock
Easier to find earning doubler in non-large cap space. For top 100 companies, they are already dominant in their space. Now they will grow at nominal GDP growth of 10-11% and for them deviate from nominal GDP growth is extremely difficult because those are the ones who are making nominal GDP. So its very difficult for the large cap who form 70% of the MCap to deviate from normal GDP growth. 

It is extremely difficult for companies to remain dominant over a decade. When one looks at top 100 companies, they are looking at companies who were dominant in last decade. Investors have to look for companies who will become dominate in next decade.  

How to avoid picking bad companies in small cap space?
There are industries which are small due to which the companies are also small. But in an industry, if you find that the gap between the dominant player and competition is wide, then the dominant player is very similar to the large cap company and can be chosen as it will continue to gain market share from its competitors.

Any common red flags in companies to look for?
- When looking for high growth companies, they have to be highly profitable in terms of ROE and ROCE. But it is very simple to manage PnL and PnL might not be supported by the cash flow in the company. If one looks at the efficiency of the cash flow accumulation compared to what is booked on the PnL side, and if cCFO is 60-70% of PAT, that itself will save you from lot of fraudulent companies. 
- Expansion - When company announces expansion, you look at the profitability of the expansion. Sometimes, pressure from market or for growth, the expansion result to incrementally lower return on capital. You cannot find companies in small cap which can grow without CAPEX. There has to be CAPEX. The incremental return on reinvested capital has to be high
-  If return is not higher than the current one but then ROE is better than the expected return (not talking about cost of capital). In a small cap space, an expected return from an investor is 17-20% so ROE has to be ahead of this or it makes sense for the company to pay dividends.

`Summary`

# Definition
A cognitive bias is a systematic error in thinking that occurs when people are processing and interpreting information in the world around them and affects the decisions and judgments that they make.

Human brain is powerful but subject to limitations. Cognitive biases are often a result of your brain's attempt to simplify information processing. Biases often work as rules of thumb that help you make sense of the world and reach decisions with relative speed.

- Biases related to memory - The way you remember an event (can be biased) can lead to biased thinking and decision making
- Biased due to problems with attention - Since attention is a limited resource, people are selective about paying attention

The concept of cognitive bias was first introduced by researchers Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman in 1972. Since then, researchers have described a number of different types of biases that affect decision-making in a wide range of areas including social behavior, cognition, behavioral economics, education, management, healthcare, business, and finance.

# Cognitive Bias vs Logical Fallacy
Logical Fallacy stems from an error in a logical argument.

Cognitive bias is rooted in thought processing. Errors often arise from problems with **memory, attention, attribution and other mental mistakes**.

# Signs
Everyone has it. It is easier to spot in others but also important to know that it is something that affects our thinking.

Some signs that you might be influenced:
- Paying attention to stories that confirm your opinion
- Blaming outside factors on failure
- Attributing other's success to luck and own credit for accomplishment
- Assuming that everyone shares your opinion or belief
- Dunning-Kruger effect - Learning little but assuming you know all 

# Types
## Actor-observer bias
Tendency to attribute your own actions to external causes while attributing other people's behaviors to internal causes.

## Anchoring bias
Tendency to rely too heavily on the very first piece of information you learn. You can use this bias to set the expectations of others by putting the first information on the table for consideration.

## Attentional bias
Tendency to pay attention to some things while simultaneously ignoring others. Like pay attention to colour of the car but ignore safety record.

## Availability Heuristic
Placing greater value on information that comes to your mind quickly. You give greater credence to this information and tend to overestimate the probability and likelihood of similar things happening in the future.

## Confirmation bias
Favouring information that conforms to your existing beliefs

## False consensus effect

## Functional fixedness

## Halo effect

## Misinformation effect

## Optimism bias

## Self-serving bias

## Dunning-Kruger effect

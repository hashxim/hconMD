`Summary`

# Definition
A cognitive bias is a systematic error in thinking that occurs when people are processing and interpreting information in the world around them and affects the decisions and judgments that they make.

Human brain is powerful but subject to limitations. Cognitive biases are often a result of your brain's attempt to simplify information processing. Biases often work as rules of thumb that help you make sense of the world and reach decisions with relative speed.

- Biases related to memory - The way you remember an event (can be biased) can lead to biased thinking and decision making
- Biased due to problems with attention - Since attention is a limited resource, people are selective about paying attention

The concept of cognitive bias was first introduced by researchers Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman in 1972. Since then, researchers have described a number of different types of biases that affect decision-making in a wide range of areas including social behavior, cognition, behavioral economics, education, management, healthcare, business, and finance.

# Cognitive Bias vs Logical Fallacy
Logical Fallacy stems from an error in a logical argument.

Cognitive bias is rooted in thought processing. Errors often arise from problems with **memory, attention, attribution and other mental mistakes**.

# Signs
Everyone has it. It is easier to spot in others but also important to know that it is something that affects our thinking.

Some signs that you might be influenced:
- Paying attention to stories that confirm your opinion
- Blaming outside factors on failure
- Attributing other's success to luck and own credit for accomplishment
- Assuming that everyone shares your opinion or belief
- Dunning-Kruger effect - Learning little but assuming you know all 

# Types
## Actor-observer bias
Tendency to attribute your own actions to external causes while attributing other people's behaviors to internal causes.

## Anchoring bias
Tendency to rely too heavily on the very first piece of information you learn. You can use this bias to set the expectations of others by putting the first information on the table for consideration.

## Attentional bias
Tendency to pay attention to some things while simultaneously ignoring others. Like pay attention to colour of the car but ignore safety record.

## Availability Heuristic
Placing greater value on information that comes to your mind quickly. You give greater credence to this information and tend to overestimate the probability and likelihood of similar things happening in the future.

## Confirmation bias
Favouring information that conforms to your existing beliefs and discounting evidence that does not conform.

## False consensus effect
Tendency to overestimate how much other people agree with you.

## Functional fixedness
Tendency to see objects as only working in a particular way. For example, if you don't have a hammer, you never consider that a big wrench can also be used to drive a nail into the wall. This could extend to people's functions, such as not realizing a personal assistant has skills to be in a leadership role.

## Halo effect
Your overall impression of a person influences how you feel and think about their character. This especially applies to physical attractiveness influencing how you rate their other qualities.

## Misinformation effect
Tendency for post-event information to interfere with the memory of the original event. It is easy to have your memory influenced by what you hear about the event from others. Knowledge of this effect has led to a mistrust of eyewitness information.

## Optimism bias
Believing that you are less likely to suffer from misfortune and more likely to attain success than your peers.

## Self-serving bias
Blame external forces when bad things happen and give yourself credit when good things happen. 

## Dunning-Kruger effect
Believe that they are smarter and more capable than they really are.

# Causes
It would take a lot of time to make even simplest choice due to sheer complexity of the world and amount of information in the environment. It would be necessary sometimes to rely on some mental shortcuts that allow us to act quickly.

Cognitive biases are caused by number of things but heuristics (mental shortcuts) pay a major contributing role. While heuristics can be surprisingly accurate, they also lead to errors in thinking.

Other factors:
- Emotions
- Individual motivations
- Limited mind's ability to process information
- Social pressure

# Impact of Cognitive Bias
- Can lead to distorted thinking

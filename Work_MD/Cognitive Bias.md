`Summary`

# Definition
A cognitive bias is a systematic error in thinking that occurs when people are processing and interpreting information in the world around them and affects the decisions and judgments that they make.

Human brain is powerful but subject to limitations. Cognitive biases are often a result of your brain's attempt to simplify information processing. Biases often work as rules of thumb that help you make sense of the world and reach decisions with relative speed.

- Biases related to memory - The way you remember an event (can be biased) can lead to biased thinking and decision making
- Biased due to problems with attention - Since attention is a limited resource, people are selective about paying attention

The concept of cognitive bias was first introduced by researchers Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman in 1972. Since then, researchers have described a number of different types of biases that affect decision-making in a wide range of areas including social behavior, cognition, behavioral economics, education, management, healthcare, business, and finance.

# Cognitive Bias vs Logical Fallacy

Cognitive bias is rooted in thought processing. Errors often arise from problems with **memory, attention, attribution and other mental mistakes**.

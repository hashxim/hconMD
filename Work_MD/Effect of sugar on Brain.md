What happens when you take sugar?
Consumed sugar activates sweet-taste receptors (past of taste buds on the tongue). These receptors send a signal up to the brain stem and from there it forks off into many area of forebrain, one of it is  cerebral cortex.

Different sections of cerebral cortex process different tastes:
- Bitter
- Salty
- Umami
- Sweet

From here, ==the signal activates the brain's reward system==. The reward system is a series of electrical and chemical pathways across several different regions of the brain. Its a complicated network but it helps answer a subconscious question: **"Should I do it again"?**. That feeling one gets after eatin

What happens in brain which makes sugary food hard to resist?

`Summary`  

What is Sugar?  
Sugar is a general term used to describe a class of molecules called carbohydrates. Found in varieties of food and drink. 
Forms of sugar:
- Glucose
- Sucrose
- Fructose
- Maltose
- Lactose
- Dextrose
- Starch
 
What happens when you take sugar?
Consumed sugar activates sweet-taste receptors (past of taste buds on the tongue). These receptors send a signal up to the brain stem and from there it forks off into many area of forebrain, one of it is  cerebral cortex.

Different sections of cerebral cortex process different tastes:
- Bitter
- Salty
- Umami
- Sweet

From here, ==the signal activates the brain's reward system==. The reward system is a series of electrical and chemical pathways across several different regions of the brain. Its a complicated network but it helps answer a subconscious question: **"Should I do it again"?**. That feeling one gets after eating some dessert is the reward system saying "Yes".

Reward system is also activated by other things also like:
- Socializing
- Sexual Behavior
- Drugs

Over-activating this reward systems kickstarts a series of unfortunate events:
- Loss of control
- craving
- increased tolerance of sugar

After sugar moves from our mouth and reaches stomach, there are also sugar receptors. These are not taste buds but they do send signals telling brain that you are full and to produce more insulin to deal with extra sugar.

The major currency of our reward system is dopamine (chemical or neurotransmitter). There are many unevenly distributed dopamine receptors in the brain. Some areas contain dense clusters of receptors and these hotspots are part of reward system. **Drugs like alcohol, nicotine, heroin send dopamine into overdrive leading some people to constantly seek that high (to be addicted)**.

Sugar also causes release of dopamine but not as violently as drugs and is rare among dopamine-inducing foods. Broccoli has no effect which probably explains why its so hard to get kids to eat their veggies.  

Balanced food
If you eat balanced meal, dopamine level spike in the reward system hotspots. But dopamine spike would

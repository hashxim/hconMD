`What happens in brain which makes sugary food hard to resist? How sugar affects different parts of the brain and what makes person crave for sugar?`  

## What is Sugar?  
Sugar is a general term used to describe a class of molecules called carbohydrates. Found in varieties of food and drink. 
Forms of sugar:
- Glucose
- Sucrose
- Fructose
- Maltose
- Lactose
- Dextrose
- Starch
 
## What happens when you take sugar?
Consumed sugar activates sweet-taste receptors (past of taste buds on the tongue). These receptors send a signal up to the brain stem and from there it forks off into many area of forebrain, one of it is  cerebral cortex.

Different sections of cerebral cortex process different tastes:
- Bitter
- Salty
- Umami
- Sweet

From here, ==the signal activates the brain's reward system==. **The reward system is a series of electrical and chemical pathways across several different regions of the brain.** Its a complicated network but it helps answer a subconscious question: **"Should I do it again"?**. That feeling one gets after eating some dessert is the reward system saying "Yes".

Reward system is also activated by other things also like:
- Socializing
- Sexual Behavior
- Drugs

Over-activating this reward systems kickstarts a series of unfortunate events:
- Loss of control
- craving
- increased tolerance of sugar

After sugar moves from our mouth and reaches stomach, there are also sugar receptors. These are not taste buds but they do send signals telling brain that you are full and to **produce more insulin to deal with extra sugar.**

## Dopamine
The major currency of our reward system is dopamine (chemical or neurotransmitter). There are many unevenly distributed dopamine receptors in the brain. Some areas contain dense clusters of receptors and these hotspots are part of reward system. **Drugs like alcohol, nicotine, heroin send dopamine into overdrive leading some people to constantly seek that high (to be addicted)**.

==Sugar also causes release of dopamine but not as violently as drugs and is rare among dopamine-inducing foods==. Broccoli has no effect which probably explains why its so hard to get kids to eat their veggies.  

## Balanced food vs High sugar food
If you eat balanced meal, dopamine level spike in the reward system hotspots. But dopamine spike would slowly subside as you take same food again and again and eventually levelling out. That's because when it comes to food, brain evolved to pay special attention to new or different tastes. This is because:
- To detect food that has gone bad
- **The more variety we have in our diet, the more nutrients we get that we need. To keep the variety, we need to recognize new food and more importantly need to keep eating new foods**. 
And that's why **dopamine level off when food becomes boring**. 

What happens when you eat sugar instead of balanced meal? 
If don't eat sugar much, the effect would be same as balanced meal. But if you eat too much sugar, the dopamine level does not level out. Eating lots of sugar will continue to feel rewarding. Here ==sugar behaves little bit like a drug because of which people are hooked on sugary foods==. **Overconsumption of sugar can have addictive effects on the brain**.

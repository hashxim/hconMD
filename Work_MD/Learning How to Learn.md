# Overlearning
Continuing to study and practice after you've mastered what you can in the session is called overlearning. It can produce automaticity that can be important when you're choke during public speaking or serve in tennis. Automaticity can be really valuable in times of nervousness. 

But repetitive overlearning during single session is waste of time.  If you have got the idea down during a session, repeated learning doesn't strengthen the kind of long term memory connections. Repeating something you already know perfectly well is easy and brings illusion of competence that you have mastered the full range of material while you have only mastered the easy stuff. Instead you would like to balance your studies by deliberately focusing on what you find difficult. 

Focussing on more difficult material is called deliberate practice.

# Overlearning
Continuing to study and practice after you've mastered what you can in the session is called overlearning. It can produce automaticity that can be important when you're choke during public speaking or serve in tennis. Automaticity can be really valuable in times of nervousness. 

But repetitive overlearning during single session is waste of time.  If you have got the idea down during a session, repeated learning doesn't strengthen the kind of long term memory connections. Repeating something you already know perfectly well is easy and brings illusion of competence that you have mastered the full range of material while you have only mastered the easy stuff. Instead you would like to balance your studies by deliberately focusing on what you find difficult. 

Focussing on more difficult material is called deliberate practice. 

# Einstellung
In this phenomenon, your initial simple thought, an idea you already have in mind or a neural pattern you've already developed and strengthened, may prevent a better idea or solution from being found.

The crowded bumpers of the focus mode and the previous patterns you built can create a sort of rut that prevents you from springing to a new place where the solution might be found. Its like installing a roadblock because of the way you were initially looking at something. 

# Sinking
This is when someone blindly start working on homework without reading the text book. Understanding how to obtain real solutions is important in learning. Learning a new subject means not learning the basic chunk but also knowing how to select and use different chunks. 

# Interleaving
The best way to learn is by practicing jumping back and forth between problems and situations that require different techniques or strategies. Interleaving makes your learning more difficult but in reality helps you learn more deeply. Although practice and repetition is important in helping build solid neural patterns to draw on, it's interleaving that starts building flexibility and creativity.


# Procrastination
We procrastinate about things that make us feel a little bit uncomfortable. You feel that you don't like something and all your pain centres in the brain light up. So you shift your focus to something more enjoyable. This temporarily feels better but has nasty long-term effects. By doing so, it will become more painful in future. 

Procrastination shares features with addiction. You start to tell yourself stories that doing something else is good for you.

# Habits
Habits are energy saver for us.  You don't think in a focused manner about what you're doing while performing the habit. 

Habits have 4 parts:
- The cue - This triggers the habit. Its the routine that we do in reaction to the cue. 
- The Routine - The routine habitual response brain falls into when it receives the cue
- The Reward - Every habit develops and continues because it rewards us. It gives us feeling of pleasure. Procrastination is an easy habit to develop since it gives needed pleasure.

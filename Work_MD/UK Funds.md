## **Definition**
A fund is a way for a group of investors to pool their money to invest in things, benefiting from economies of scale, more flexibility

## **Kinds of Fund**
- Open Ended - where the number of shares or units in it isn’t fixed.
- Closed Ended - where the number of shares or units is fixed. This is usually at the point the fund is established, where everyone pools their money and gets shares in return.

### Closed Ended Fund
**Setup:** When the fund is set up, they issue shares. Sometimes you can sell those shares on, sometimes you can’t – some of those companies are exchange traded: so you can buy and sell those shares amongst other investors, but you don’t generally buy or sell them from/to the fund itself.

Sometimes it may want to raise more money by selling shares to the investor which is called **offering**

- OEIC or ICVC - Open Ended Investment Company (OEIC) or Investment Company with Variable Capital (ICVC). Mostly deal with this one.
- Authorised Unit Trusts - an older way of setting things up where there isn’t a company involved, but a trust
- Authorised Contractual Schemes - a new way of setting things up where it’s a series of contracts

#### ICVC 
**Setup:** Is an actual company - has board of directors and shareholders. Has to publish accounts and get audited. Need special rules:

- Investment manager required
- Have to have depository - independent company that legally holds all the company property.
- It can be an umbrella company - one ICVC have multiple sub-funds.

It can be ETF but not close ended. When there is huge demand for ETF, ICVC issues a lot of shares to big brokers and investment banks who then add those shares to the market,

Difference between normal ICVS and ETF ICVC?
Normal ICVC lets you buy or sell when they say you can which ETF can be freely traded. Normal ICVC will buy or sell based on NAV while in ETF, prices is decided by the exchange. Thus ETF can trade at premium or discount to the NAV.

## **Definition**
A fund is a way for a group of investors to pool their money to invest in things, benefiting from economies of scale, more flexibility

## **Kinds of Fund**
- Open Ended - where the number of shares or units in it isn’t fixed.
- Closed Ended - where the number of shares or units is fixed. This is usually at the point the fund is established, where everyone pools their money and gets shares in return.

### Closed Ended Fund
**Setup:** When the fund is set up, they issue shares. Sometimes you can sell those shares on, sometimes you can’t – some of those companies are exchange traded: so you can buy and sell those shares amongst other investors, but you don’t generally buy or sell them from/to the fund itself.

## Why is there extreme dispersion in outcomes, from similar starting points?
This is due to **multiplicative probabilities.**

Buggy humans like tying these down to single causes. However, reality is fuzzier, with a bunch of factors that just happened to line up in a certain direction. 

Multiplicative probabilities can have an especially severe effect at the opposite end. 

_As an example, Indian companies have had a disastrous experience with overseas acquisitions. Going in, these adventures didn’t seem particularly egregious. However, a ==whole host of seemingly small differences between acquirer and acquiree – context, people, culture, distance, distribution setup, weaker competitive position, business profile – made a big difference to the final outcome. While each difference, in itself, might have reduced odds of success by a small amount, their multiplicative effect was disastrous==._

An appreciation of this concept results in paranoia about avoiding ‘zeroes’ anywhere in the chain. Big-bang M&A, high debt or dodgy promoters can nullify a lot of other positives in a business.
